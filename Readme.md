git commit -m "initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/hariiisai/smartnotes.git
git branch -M main

```

#### Project setup
1. Create a first app called home `django-admin startapp home` and add 'home' in installed apps of 'settings.py'
2. Create 'home.html' and render 'url:home' to this html by view.home
3. Include 'home.urls' in main url file

#### Adding Users 
1. Before creating users we need to setup database connection so users will be stored
2. To do this we can simply run `python manage.py migrate` to apply built-in migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.
3. Create a admin user now `python manage.py createsuperuser`
4. Created a authorised page which can be viewed by loggedin users

1. Create a new app notes `django-admin startapp notes` and add it in 'setting.py'
2. Create a model 'notes' in 'models.py' of notes folder
3. To make a relation of this model, we need to make migrations `python manage.py makemigrations`
4. Perform actual migration `python manage.py migrate` # The table 'notes' will be created in database
5. Register you model in 'admin.py'
6. Now you can manage 'notes' model from admin page
